Click Counter is a Udacity excercise in the UIKit Fundamentals Outlets and Actions section of their iOS Nanodegree course.

Buttons were added with code only, without the Storyboard. The first button was under instruction, and two more were requested. The first was originallt named button, but was renamed incrementButton. i then added a decrement button and a randomColorButton. The latter is linked to a true randomized color picker that changes the app background.


The excercise currently lives here:
